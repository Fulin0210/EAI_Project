- **Dynamic Calendar View**: Real-time calendar interface to view scheduled bookings.
- **RESTful API Integration**: Backend services connect client and event data smoothly.
- **Database Integration**: SQL Server database designed to manage users, bookings, and events with enforced constraints and relationships.
